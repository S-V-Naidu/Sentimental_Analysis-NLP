Marketing Drives Results With A Focus On Problems | Blackcoffer Insights
Marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product, price, place and promotion strategies. Marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly, boiling down to vital three. These are &#8216;What type of customer are marketing team is focusing on (based on gender, age, location, customer-class) (W1)&#8217;, &#8216;What are Product Specification or Applications you need to bring in front of customer (W2)&#8217;, &#8216;What is your Product Promotion flow path (W3)&#8217;, &#8216;How much time it takes to convey product information to customer (H1)&#8217;. These criteria are what I call &#8216;3W1H&#8217; forms. These basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product. However, are they enough? No. There is one more parameter called the Feedback mechanism (FM). Generally, machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not, the input is corrected to get the required output. When it comes to human beings, he/she is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media, TV advertising and so forth. Slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumer’s mind. In the feedback mechanism, the marketing team needs to answer only one question “What kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities?” If the product image not built as per expectation, then management has to review and work on 3W1H, as discussed earlier. So let’s elaborate how 3W1H approach works along with feedback mechanism.
